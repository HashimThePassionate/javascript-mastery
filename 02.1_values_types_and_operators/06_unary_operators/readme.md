# Unary Operators in JavaScript

### What are Unary Operators?
Unary operators are operators that operate on only one value. Not all operators are symbols; some are written as words. An example is the `typeof` operator.

### The `typeof` Operator
The `typeof` operator returns a string naming the type of the value you provide.

Examples:
```javascript
console.log(typeof 4.5); // → "number"
console.log(typeof "x"); // → "string"
```

### Using `console.log`
In examples, `console.log` is used to display the result of evaluating expressions.

### Binary vs. Unary Operators
- **Binary Operators**: Operate on two values.
- **Unary Operators**: Operate on one value.

### Example of Unary Minus Operator
The minus operator (`-`) can function both as a binary operator (subtracting two values) and a unary operator (negating a value).

Example:
```javascript
console.log(-(10 - 2)); // → -8
```

In this example, the unary minus operator negates the result of the expression `(10 - 2)`.
