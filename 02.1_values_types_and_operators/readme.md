# Understanding Data in Computers

In the computer's world, everything is data. You can read, modify, and create data, but anything that isn't data cannot be mentioned. All data is stored as long sequences of bits, making it fundamentally alike.

## What are Bits?

Bits are the basic units of data in computing. They can have two values, typically represented as 0 and 1. Inside a computer, bits can be high or low electrical charges, strong or weak signals, or shiny or dull spots on a CD. Any piece of information can be converted into a sequence of bits.

## Example: Representing Numbers with Bits

Let's take the number 13 as an example. In the binary (base-2) system, which computers use, numbers are represented with only two digits: 0 and 1. Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2, increasing from right to left.

Here is how the number 13 is represented in binary:

```
0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
128 64 32 16 8  4 2 1
```

In this binary number, the non-zero digits are in positions representing 8, 4, and 1. Adding these values together (8 + 4 + 1) gives us 13.

Thus, the binary representation of 13 is `00001101`.

## Summary

- **Data in Computers**: Everything is data, stored as sequences of bits.
- **Bits**: Basic units of data, represented as 0 and 1.
- **Binary System**: A method to represent numbers using only 0 and 1, with each position representing a power of 2.

This is how computers understand and manipulate all the information we use.
