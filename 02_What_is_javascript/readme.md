# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript was introduced in 1995 to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser. It has since become essential for modern web applications, enabling direct interaction without page reloads. JavaScript is also used in traditional websites for various forms of interactivity.

### Key Points:

- **JavaScript vs. Java**: Despite the similar names, JavaScript has almost nothing to do with Java. The name was a marketing strategy to capitalize on Java's popularity at the time.
- **Standardization**: JavaScript's standardization is handled by the ECMAScript standard, ensuring consistency across different browsers and platforms. ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable terms.
- **Flexibility and Issues**: JavaScript is known for its liberal syntax, which can make debugging difficult but allows for flexible and informal programming styles. Initially challenging, it becomes enjoyable with proper understanding and practice.
- **Version Evolution**: JavaScript has evolved through several versions:
  - ECMAScript 3 (2000-2010): Widely supported during JavaScriptâ€™s rise.
  - ECMAScript 5 (2009): Introduced uncontroversial improvements.
  - ECMAScript 6 (2015): Major update with significant features.
  - Annual updates: Ensuring the language stays current without breaking existing programs.
- **Usage Beyond Browsers**: JavaScript is used in databases like MongoDB and CouchDB, and in server-side environments such as Node.js, providing a versatile platform for various applications.

JavaScript's ongoing evolution ensures compatibility with old programs while introducing new features, making it a robust choice for web and server-side development.
