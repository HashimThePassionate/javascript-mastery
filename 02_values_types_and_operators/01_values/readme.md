# Values in Computers

Imagine a sea of bits—an ocean of them. A modern computer has over 100 billion bits in its working memory (volatile data storage). Nonvolatile storage (like a hard disk) has even more bits.

## Understanding Values In Javascript

To work with these bits, we group them into chunks called values. In a JavaScript environment, these values represent pieces of information. Even though all values are made of bits, they serve different purposes. Each value has a type that determines its role:
- **Numbers**: Represent numerical data.
- **Text**: Represent pieces of text.
- **Functions**: Represent executable code.

## Creating Values

Creating a value is simple—just invoke its name, and it appears. You don’t need to gather materials or pay for them. However, each value occupies space in the computer's memory. If you create too many values at once, you might run out of memory. Fortunately, this is rarely an issue. Once you stop using a value, its memory is freed up and can be reused for new values.

In summary:
- **Values**: Chunks of bits representing information.
- **Types**: Define the role of each value (numbers, text, functions, etc.).
- **Memory**: Values occupy memory, but unused values free up space for new ones.
