# Understanding Data Structures

## Introduction

Numbers, Booleans, and strings are the fundamental elements from which data structures are created. However, many types of information require more than just these simple elements.

## Importance of Objects

Objects allow us to group values, including other objects, to build more complex structures. This capability is essential for managing more intricate types of information.

## Current Limitations

The programs we have built so far have been limited to operating on simple data types. This limitation restricts the complexity and usefulness of our programs.

## Learning Data Structures

After learning the basics of data structures in this section, you will be equipped to start writing more useful programs.

## Section Overview

This repository section will guide you through a realistic programming example. Concepts will be introduced as they apply to the problem at hand. The example code will often build on functions and bindings introduced earlier.

## Goals

- Understand the role of basic data types.
- Learn how to group values using objects.
- Build more complex data structures.
- Apply data structure concepts to solve practical problems.

By the end of this section, you'll have the knowledge needed to start creating more sophisticated and functional programs.
