## 1. 🛡️ **How to Enable Strict Mode**

To enable strict mode in JavaScript, simply add the following line at the beginning of your script or function:

```javascript
"use strict";
```

### 🔍 **Example: Enabling Strict Mode in a Function**

```javascript
function canYouSpotTheProblem() {
  "use strict";
  for (counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++) {
    console.log("Happy happy");
  }
}

canYouSpotTheProblem();
// 🚫 ReferenceError: counter is not defined
```

### 💡 **Explanation:**

In the example above, strict mode is enabled inside the `canYouSpotTheProblem` function. Because of strict mode, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError` when it encounters the `counter` variable, which was not declared using `let`, `const`, or `var`. In non-strict mode, this would have silently created a global variable, potentially leading to bugs.

## 2. 🏫 **Automatic Strict Mode in Classes and Modules**

When writing code inside **classes** or **modules**, strict mode is automatically applied. This promotes better coding practices and ensures that your code adheres to stricter rules without needing to explicitly declare `"use strict";`.

### 📚 **Example: Strict Mode in Classes**

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}

const alice = new Person("Alice");
alice.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, my name is Alice
```

**Note:** Even without specifying `"use strict";`, the above class operates in strict mode, enforcing better practices and preventing common mistakes.

## 3. 💼 **Benefits of Strict Mode**

Enabling strict mode offers numerous advantages that enhance the reliability and maintainability of your JavaScript code. Here's an in-depth look at the key benefits:

### 1. 🛑 **Prevents Accidental Global Variables**

Without strict mode, forgetting to declare a variable results in JavaScript creating a global variable, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Example Without Strict Mode:**

```javascript
for (counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++) {
  console.log(counter);
}
// ⚠️ No error, but 'counter' becomes a global variable
```

**Example With Strict Mode:**

```javascript
"use strict";

for (counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++) {
  console.log(counter);
}
// 🚫 ReferenceError: counter is not defined
```

**Benefit:** Prevents unintended creation of global variables, reducing the risk of variable collisions and bugs.

### 2. 🧭 **Changes to `this` Binding**

In non-strict mode, if you call a function without using it as a method, `this` refers to the global object. In strict mode, `this` is `undefined` in such cases, preventing unintended side effects.

**Example Without Strict Mode:**

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let ferdinand = Person("Ferdinand"); // Forgot 'new'
console.log(name); // 🛑 Outputs: Ferdinand (global variable in non-strict mode)
```

**Example With Strict Mode:**

```javascript
"use strict";

function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let ferdinand = Person("Ferdinand"); // Forgot 'new'
// 🚫 TypeError: Cannot set property 'name' of undefined
```

**Benefit:** Ensures that functions intended to be constructors are used correctly with the `new` keyword, preventing accidental modification of the global object.

### 3. 🏗️ **Error Prevention in Constructors**

In strict mode, if you forget to use the `new` keyword when calling a constructor, an error is thrown, preventing accidental global variable creation. Even in non-strict mode, constructors created with the `class` syntax enforce this rule.

**Example With Class Syntax (Always Strict):**

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(model) {
    this.model = model;
  }
}

const myCar = new Car("Tesla");
// Correct usage

const anotherCar = Car("Ford");
// 🚫 TypeError: Class constructor Car cannot be invoked without 'new'
```

**Benefit:** Enforces proper use of constructors, ensuring that objects are instantiated correctly.

### 4. 🌟 **Additional Strict Mode Features**

- **🚫 Disallows Duplicate Parameter Names:**
  
  Prevents having two parameters with the same name in a function, reducing confusion and potential bugs.
  
  **Example:**
  
  ```javascript
  "use strict";
  
  function sum(a, a, c) { // SyntaxError: Duplicate parameter name not allowed in this context
    return a + a + c;
  }
  
  sum(1, 2, 3);
  ```

- **❌ Removes Problematic Features:**
  
  Strict mode removes certain JavaScript features that are considered problematic or can lead to bugs, such as the `with` statement.
  
  **Example:**
  
  ```javascript
  "use strict";
  
  with (Math) { // SyntaxError: Strict mode code may not include a with statement
    x = cos(2);
  }
  ```

**Benefit:** Enhances code safety by eliminating features that can make code harder to understand and maintain.

## 4. 🔍 **Common Strict Mode Errors**

Enabling strict mode can help catch a variety of common mistakes. Here's a closer look at some typical errors you might encounter:

### 1. 🚫 **Assigning to Undeclared Variables**

Attempting to assign a value to a variable that hasn't been declared will throw a `ReferenceError`.

**Example:**

```javascript
"use strict";

function assignValue() {
  undeclaredVar = 10; // ReferenceError: undeclaredVar is not defined
}

assignValue();
```

### 2. 🔄 **Duplicate Parameter Names**

Having two parameters with the same name in a function is not allowed in strict mode.

**Example:**

```javascript
"use strict";

function multiply(a, a) { // SyntaxError: Duplicate parameter name not allowed in this context
  return a * a;
}

multiply(2, 3);
```

### 3. 🧹 **Deleting Un deletable Properties**

Strict mode prohibits the deletion of variables, functions, or function arguments.

**Example:**

```javascript
"use strict";

let x = 5;
delete x; // TypeError: Cannot delete property 'x' of #<Object>
```

### 4. 🛑 **Using `with` Statement**

The `with` statement is disallowed in strict mode as it can make code execution unpredictable.

**Example:**

```javascript
"use strict";

with (Math) { // SyntaxError: Strict mode code may not include a with statement
  console.log(cos(0));
}
```

## 5. 🛠️ **Best Practices When Using Strict Mode**

To maximize the benefits of strict mode and minimize potential issues, consider the following best practices:

### 1. 🧰 **Always Use Strict Mode**

- **Enable Globally or Locally:**
  
  - **Globally:** Add `"use strict";` at the top of your JavaScript files.
    
    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    
    // All code in this file is in strict mode
    function example() {
      // ...
    }
    ```
  
  - **Locally:** Add `"use strict";` inside functions to apply strict mode only within them.
    
    ```javascript
    function example() {
      "use strict";
      // Strict mode applies here
    }
    ```

### 2. 📏 **Declare All Variables Properly**

- **Use `let`, `const`, or `var`:**
  
  Always declare your variables using `let`, `const`, or `var` to avoid accidental global variable creation.
  
  ```javascript
  "use strict";
  
  function add(a, b) {
    let sum = a + b;
    return sum;
  }
  
  add(2, 3);
  ```

### 3. 🔗 **Use `const` and `let` Instead of `var`**

- **Benefits:**
  
  - **`const`:** For variables that should not be reassigned.
  - **`let`:** For block-scoped variables that may be reassigned.
  - **Avoid `var`:** Prevents scope-related bugs and hoisting issues.
  
  **Example:**
  
  ```javascript
  "use strict";
  
  const PI = 3.14; // Constant, cannot be reassigned
  let radius = 5; // Variable, can be reassigned
  
  radius = 10; // Valid
  // PI = 3.14159; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
  ```

### 4. 🕵️‍♂️ **Use Tools to Catch Errors Early**

- **Linters and Static Analysis:**
  
  - **ESLint:** Helps identify and fix problems in your JavaScript code.
  
    ```bash
    npm install eslint --save-dev
    ```
  
  - **Setup Example:**
    
    ```bash
    npx eslint --init
    ```
  
  - **Benefits:** Automatically catches syntax errors, undefined variables, and enforces coding standards.

### 5. 🧪 **Write Tests to Validate Your Code**

- **Unit Testing:**
  
  Write tests for individual functions to ensure they behave as expected.
  
  - **Frameworks:** Jest, Mocha, Jasmine.
  
  **Example with Jest:**
  
  ```javascript
  // sum.js
  function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
  
  module.exports = sum;
  
  // sum.test.js
  const sum = require('./sum');
  
  test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
  });
  ```

### 6. 📚 **Educate Yourself and Your Team**

- **Continuous Learning:**
  
  Stay updated with the latest JavaScript features and best practices.
  
- **Code Reviews:**
  
  Regularly review code with peers to catch potential issues and promote consistent coding standards.
