# 🐞 Bugs and Errors

Flaws in computer programs are usually called **bugs**. 🐛 It makes programmers feel good to imagine them as little things that just happen to crawl into our work. In reality, of course, we put them there ourselves. 💻

If a program is crystallized thought, we can roughly categorize bugs into two types:

1. **Confused Thoughts Bugs**: 🧠 These are caused by the thoughts being confused. This type is generally harder to diagnose and fix because it involves understanding and clarifying the underlying logic or design.

2. **Conversion Mistake Bugs**: 🔧 These are caused by mistakes introduced while converting a thought to code. These bugs are usually easier to identify and correct because they involve direct coding errors, such as typos or incorrect syntax.
