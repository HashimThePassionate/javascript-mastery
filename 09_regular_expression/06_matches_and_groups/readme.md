## ➕ The `test()` Method ✅

The **`test()`** method is the simplest way to check if a string contains a pattern defined by a regular expression. It returns a simple `true` or `false` and is ideal for quick checks. 🕒✨

### 📝 How `test()` Works

- **Purpose**: To **verify the presence** of a pattern within a string.
- **Return Value**: `true` if the pattern is found, `false` otherwise.
- **Usage**: Best suited for scenarios where you need a **boolean** response, such as form validations.

**Syntax**:
```javascript
regex.test(string);
```

- **`regex`**: The regular expression pattern to search for.
- **`string`**: The string to be tested against the regex.

### 📌 Example: Checking for Numbers

Let’s see how the `test()` method works with a practical example where we check if a string contains any digits.

```javascript
let isNumberPresent = /\d+/.test("one two 100");
console.log(isNumberPresent); 
// → true
```

**💡 Explanation:**

- **Pattern**: `/\d+/`
  - **`\d`**: Shorthand for any digit character (`0-9`).
  - **`+`**: Ensures that **one or more** digits are present.
- **Method Call**: `/\d+/.test("one two 100")`
  - **"one two 100"**: The string to test.
  - **Result**: `true` because "100" contains digits.

If the string were `"one two"`, the result would be `false` since there are no digits.

### ⚠️ When to Use `test()`

- **Existence Check**: When you need to **verify the presence** of a pattern without needing more details.
- **Form Validation**: For quick checks like ensuring a password contains a digit or validating an email format.
- **Performance**: `test()` is generally faster for simple existence checks compared to methods that return more information.

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ The `exec()` Method: Detailed Matching 🕵️

The **`exec()`** method is far more detailed and versatile than `test()`. It searches for a match in a string and returns an array containing information about the match and its captured groups. 🧩🔍

### 📝 How `exec()` Works

- **Purpose**: To **find detailed information** about a match within a string.
- **Return Value**: An **array** containing match details or `null` if no match is found.
- **Usage**: Ideal for scenarios where you need to **extract specific parts** of the matched string.

**Syntax**:
```javascript
regex.exec(string);
```

- **`regex`**: The regular expression pattern to search for.
- **`string`**: The string to be tested against the regex.

### 📌 Example: Extracting Match Details

Let’s explore how `exec()` works with an example where we extract information from a string.

```javascript
let match = /\d+/.exec("one two 100");
console.log(match);        // → ["100"]
console.log(match.index);  // → 8
console.log(match.input);  // → "one two 100"
```

**💡 Explanation:**

- **Pattern**: `/\d+/`
  - **`\d+`**: Matches **one or more digits**.
- **Method Call**: `/\d+/.exec("one two 100")`
  - **"one two 100"**: The string to test.
  - **Result**: `["100"]`
    - **`match[0]`**: The full match `"100"`.
    - **`match.index`**: The position where the match starts (`8`).
    - **`match.input`**: The original string `"one two 100"`.

If the string were `"one two"`, `exec()` would return `null` since there are no digits.

### ⚠️ When to Use `exec()`

- **Detailed Information**: When you need **specific details** about the match, such as its position or captured groups.
- **Data Extraction**: Ideal for **parsing** and **extracting** parts of a string, like pulling out dates or URLs.
- **Iterative Searches**: When combined with the `g` flag, `exec()` can be used in loops to find **all matches** in a string.

---

## 🔍 Using the `match()` Method from Strings 🔍

Strings in JavaScript have a built-in **`match()`** method that works similarly to `exec()`, but it's more straightforward to use directly on strings. 📚🔧

### 📝 How `match()` Works

- **Purpose**: To **find matches** within a string using a regex.
- **Return Value**: An **array** of matches or `null` if no match is found.
- **Usage**: Simplifies the process of finding matches without needing to work directly with a regex object.

**Syntax**:
```javascript
string.match(regex);
```

- **`string`**: The string to search within.
- **`regex`**: The regular expression pattern to search for.

### 📌 Example: Finding All Matches

Let’s see how `match()` works with an example where we find all occurrences of a pattern in a string.

```javascript
let matches = "one two 100 three 200".match(/\d+/g);
console.log(matches); 
// → ["100", "200"]
```

**💡 Explanation:**

- **Pattern**: `/\d+/g`
  - **`\d+`**: Matches **one or more digits**.
  - **`g` Flag**: Stands for **global**, meaning it searches for **all matches** in the string.
- **Method Call**: `"one two 100 three 200".match(/\d+/g)`
  - **"one two 100 three 200"**: The string to search.
  - **Result**: `["100", "200"]` – An array of all digit sequences found.

If the regex lacks the `g` flag, `match()` will return only the **first match**.

### ⚠️ When to Use `match()`

- **Simpler Syntax**: When you prefer to work directly with strings rather than regex objects.
- **Multiple Matches**: When you need to find **all occurrences** of a pattern using the `g` flag.
- **Basic Extraction**: Suitable for extracting matches without needing detailed information like their positions.

---

## 🎯 Groups in Regular Expressions: Using Parentheses 🎯

Groups are one of the most powerful features of regular expressions. When you use **parentheses `()`** in a regex, you create a **capturing group**. Groups allow you to extract specific parts of the matched string, making regex patterns more dynamic and useful. 🛠️🔍

### 📝 How Groups Work

- **Capturing Groups**: Portions of the regex enclosed in parentheses `()` capture the matched content for later use.
- **Accessing Groups**: Captured groups can be accessed via the returned array from methods like `exec()` or `match()`.
- **Nested Groups**: You can have groups within groups for more complex matching.

### 📌 Example: Capturing Quoted Text

Let’s look at an example where we extract text enclosed within single quotes.

```javascript
let quotedText = /'([^']*)'/;
let match = quotedText.exec("she said 'hello'");
console.log(match);
// → ["'hello'", "hello"]
let input1 = "My favorite book is 'Harry Potter'".match(quotedText);
let input2 = "He shouted 'Stop right there!'".match(quotedText);
let input3 = "The code is: 'let x = 10;'".match(quotedText);
let input4 = "I heard him say 'goodbye'".match(quotedText);
let input5 = "This is just a test without quotes".match(quotedText);
```

**💡 Explanation:**

- **Pattern**: `/'([^']*)'/`
  - **`'`**: Matches the **literal single quote**.
  - **`([^']*)`**:
    - **`[^']`**: A **negated character set** that matches any character **except** a single quote.
    - **`*`**: Allows for **zero or more** of these characters.
    - **`()`**: **Captures** the matched characters inside the quotes.
  - **`'`**: Matches the closing **literal single quote**.
- **Method Call**: `/\'([^']*)\'/.exec("she said 'hello'")`
  - **"she said 'hello'"**: The string to test.
  - **Result**: `["'hello'", "hello"]`
    - **`match[0]`**: The full match `"'hello'"`.
    - **`match[1]`**: The captured group `"hello"`.

This allows you to easily extract the content within quotes without the quotes themselves.

### ⚠️ When to Use Groups

- **Data Extraction**: When you need to **extract specific parts** of a matched string.
- **Complex Patterns**: To apply operators to **entire subpatterns**, enhancing flexibility.
- **Reusability**: Captured groups can be reused in replacement strings or for further processing.

---

## ♻️ Groups with Optional Matches and Repetition ♻️

Groups can be made **optional** or **repeated** to handle more flexible and complex pattern matching. This enhances the ability of regex to adapt to varying input formats. 🌟🔄

### 📝 Optional Groups `?`

- **Purpose**: Makes a group **optional**, meaning it can appear **zero or one time**.
- **Syntax**: `(...) ?`
- **Usage**: Ideal for patterns where a part may or may not be present.

### 📌 Example: Optional "ly" in "badly"

Let’s consider a regex that matches the word "bad" with an optional "ly" suffix.

```javascript
console.log(/bad(ly)?/.exec("bad"));
/*
→ ["bad", undefined]
*/
let regex = new RegExp("begin(ing)?",'ig');
let str1 = "begining of the project";
let str2 = "it will begin shortly";
let str3 = "Begining is crucial";
let str4 = "began or begining?";
let str5 = "we will begin again";
console.log(regex.exec(str5));

```

**💡 Explanation:**

- **Pattern**: `/bad(ly)?/`
  - **`bad`**: Matches the literal string "bad".
  - **`(ly)?`**:
    - **`ly`**: Matches the literal string "ly".
    - **`?`**: Makes the entire group **optional**.
- **Method Call**: `/bad(ly)?/.exec("bad")`
  - **"bad"**: The string to test.
  - **Result**: `["bad", undefined]`
    - **`match[0]`**: The full match `"bad"`.
    - **`match[1]`**: `undefined` because "ly" is not present.

If the string were `"badly"`, `match[1]` would be `"ly"`.

### 📝 Repeated Groups `+`

- **Purpose**: Matches **one or more occurrences** of a group.
- **Syntax**: `(...)+`
- **Usage**: Perfect for patterns that require **repetition**, such as multiple digits or repeated words.

### 📌 Example: Repeating Digits

Let’s see how a regex can capture repeated digits.

```javascript
console.log(/(\d)+/.exec("123"));
/*
→ ["123", "3"]
*/
let regex = new RegExp('(\\d)+','g');
let str1 = "Price is $1101 - $120 - $1";
let str2 = "Order ID: 789654";          
let str3 = "There are 24 apples";       
let str4 = "No digits here!";         
let str5 = "My lucky number is 7";      
let str6 = "Contact: +923001234567";    
let str7 = "Version 2.1.0";             
let str8 = "Temperature: -15°C";        
let str9 = "Model X2024";               
let str10 = "Coordinates: 34.056, -118.245"; 

console.log(str1.match(regex));
```

**💡 Explanation:**

- **Pattern**: `/(\d)+/`
  - **`(\d)`**: Captures a single digit.
  - **`+`**: Ensures that the digit is repeated **one or more times**.
- **Method Call**: `/(\d)+/.exec("123")`
  - **"123"**: The string to test.
  - **Result**: `["123", "3"]`
    - **`match[0]`**: The full match `"123"`.
    - **`match[1]`**: The **last** captured group `"3"`. Note that when using `+` with groups, only the **last iteration** of the group is captured.

If the string were `"1"`, the result would be `["1", "1"]`.

### ⚠️ When to Use Optional and Repeated Groups

- **Optional Groups**:
  - **Use Case**: Patterns that may **optionally include** certain elements, such as optional suffixes or prefixes.
  - **Example**: Matching "color" and "colour" with `/colou?r/`.
- **Repeated Groups**:
  - **Use Case**: Patterns that require **multiple repetitions**, such as repeated digits, letters, or words.
  - **Example**: Matching sequences like "12345" with `/(\d)+/`.

**Best Practices**:
- **Clarity**: Use grouping operators to clearly define which parts of the pattern should be optional or repeated.
- **Avoid Overuse**: While powerful, excessive grouping can make regex patterns complex and harder to maintain.

## 🚫 Non-Capturing Groups with `?:` 🚫

Sometimes, you may want to **group parts of a regex** without capturing them. This is where **non-capturing groups** `(?:...)` come in handy. They allow you to group elements for applying operators without cluttering the match results with unnecessary captures. 🎯✨

### 📝 How Non-Capturing Groups Work

- **Syntax**: `(?:...)`
- **Purpose**: Groups parts of the regex for applying operators **without capturing** the matched content.
- **Usage**: Useful when you need to apply repetition or alternation to a group but don’t need to capture the group’s content.

### 📌 Example: Matching "na" Repeatedly

Let’s look at an example where we match the pattern "na" repeated multiple times without capturing each "na".

```javascript
console.log(/(?:na)+/.exec("banana"));
/*
→ ["nana"]
*/
```

**💡 Explanation:**

- **Pattern**: `/(?:na)+/`
  - **`(?:na)`**: 
    - **`na`**: The literal string "na".
    - **`?:`**: Indicates that this is a **non-capturing group**.
  - **`+`**: Ensures that "na" is repeated **one or more times**.
- **Method Call**: `/(?:na)+/.exec("banana")`
  - **"banana"**: The string to test.
  - **Result**: `["nana"]`
    - **`match[0]`**: The full match `"nana"`.
    - **No additional captures** since the group is non-capturing.

If the group were capturing, `match[1]` would contain the last "na" captured, but with non-capturing groups, only the full match is returned.

### ⚠️ When to Use Non-Capturing Groups

- **Logical Grouping**: When you need to group parts of a regex to apply operators like `+`, `*`, or `?` without needing to capture the group.
- **Performance**: Non-capturing groups can be slightly more performant since the regex engine doesn’t need to store the captured content.
- **Cleaner Results**: Keeps the match results **cleaner** by avoiding unnecessary captured groups, especially in complex regex patterns.

**Best Practices**:
- **Use Sparingly**: Only use non-capturing groups when you **don't** need to capture the group’s content.
- **Clarity**: Ensure that the use of non-capturing groups makes the regex pattern more readable and maintainable.

## 🌟 Real-World Example 1: Extracting Dates 🗓️

Regular expressions are ideal for extracting **dates** from text, especially when working with date strings in specific formats. Let’s see how grouping can help in extracting different parts of a date. 📅🔍

### 📌 Example: Parsing a Date String

Suppose you have a date string in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` and you want to extract the year, month, and day separately.

```javascript
let datePattern = /(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})/;
let dateString = "2024-09-08";
let match = datePattern.exec(dateString);

console.log(match);
// → ["2024-09-08", "2024", "09", "08"]

let year = match[1];
let month = match[2];
let day = match[3];

let dateObject = new Date(year, month - 1, day); // Month is 0-based
console.log(dateObject);
// → Sun Sep 08 2024
```

**💡 Explanation:**

- **Pattern**: `/(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})/`
  - **`(\d{4})`**:
    - **`\d{4}`**: Matches **exactly four digits** (the year).
    - **`()`**: **Captures** the matched digits as a group.
  - **`-`**: Matches the literal hyphen `-`.
  - **`(\d{2})`**:
    - **`\d{2}`**: Matches **exactly two digits** (the month).
    - **`()`**: **Captures** the matched digits as a group.
  - **`-`**: Matches the literal hyphen `-`.
  - **`(\d{2})`**:
    - **`\d{2}`**: Matches **exactly two digits** (the day).
    - **`()`**: **Captures** the matched digits as a group.
- **Method Call**: `/(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})/.exec("2024-09-08")`
  - **Result**: `["2024-09-08", "2024", "09", "08"]`
    - **`match[0]`**: The full match `"2024-09-08"`.
    - **`match[1]`**: Captured year `"2024"`.
    - **`match[2]`**: Captured month `"09"`.
    - **`match[3]`**: Captured day `"08"`.
- **Creating a Date Object**:
  - **`new Date(year, month - 1, day)`**:
    - **`month - 1`**: JavaScript `Date` objects use **0-based indexing** for months (0 = January, 11 = December).
    - **Result**: `Sun Sep 08 2024`.

This example demonstrates how grouping can be used to **extract specific parts** of a matched pattern for further processing.

### ⚠️ When to Use Date Extraction

- **Data Processing**: When parsing logs, user input, or data files that include date strings.
- **Validation**: To ensure that dates are in the correct format and within valid ranges.
- **Conversion**: Transforming date strings into JavaScript `Date` objects for date manipulation and calculations.

---

## 🌟 Real-World Example 2: Parsing URLs 🌐

Regular expressions can also parse URLs to extract components like **protocol**, **domain**, and **path**, which is common in web development. Let’s explore how grouping helps in dissecting a URL into its parts. 🕸️🔍

### 📌 Example: Extracting URL Components

Suppose you have a URL and you want to extract its protocol, domain, and path.

```javascript
let urlPattern = /(\w+):\/\/([\w\.]+)\/(.*)/;
let url = "https://www.example.com/path/to/page";
let match = urlPattern.exec(url);

console.log(match);
// → ["https://www.example.com/path/to/page", "https", "www.example.com", "path/to/page"]

let protocol = match[1];
let domain = match[2];
let path = match[3];

console.log(`Protocol: ${protocol}`);  // "https"
console.log(`Domain: ${domain}`);      // "www.example.com"
console.log(`Path: ${path}`);          // "path/to/page"
```

**💡 Explanation:**

- **Pattern**: `/(\w+):\/\/([\w\.]+)\/(.*)/`
  - **`(\w+)`**:
    - **`\w+`**: Matches **one or more word characters** (letters, digits, underscores).
    - **`()`**: **Captures** the protocol (e.g., `http`, `https`).
  - **`:\/\/`**:
    - **`:`**: Matches the literal colon `:`.
    - **`\/\/`**: Matches the literal `//`. Each `/` is escaped with a backslash `\`.
  - **`([\w\.]+)`**:
    - **`[\w\.]+`**: Matches **one or more** word characters or dots `.` (the domain).
    - **`()`**: **Captures** the domain name.
  - **`\/(.*)`**:
    - **`\/`**: Matches the literal forward slash `/`.
    - **`(.*)`**: 
      - **`.`**: Matches any character except newline.
      - **`*`**: Matches **zero or more** of the preceding element.
      - **`()`**: **Captures** the path.
- **Method Call**: `/(\w+):\/\/([\w\.]+)\/(.*)/.exec("https://www.example.com/path/to/page")`
  - **Result**: `["https://www.example.com/path/to/page", "https", "www.example.com", "path/to/page"]`
    - **`match[0]`**: The full match.
    - **`match[1]`**: Captured protocol `"https"`.
    - **`match[2]`**: Captured domain `"www.example.com"`.
    - **`match[3]`**: Captured path `"path/to/page"`.
- **Extracted Components**:
  - **Protocol**: `"https"`
  - **Domain**: `"www.example.com"`
  - **Path**: `"path/to/page"`

This demonstrates how grouping can be used to **break down** a complex string like a URL into its constituent parts for easier manipulation and analysis.

### ⚠️ When to Use URL Parsing

- **Web Development**: When handling redirects, link validation, or dynamic content generation based on URLs.
- **Data Analysis**: Extracting domains from datasets for analytics.
- **API Development**: Parsing URLs to route requests or extract query parameters.
